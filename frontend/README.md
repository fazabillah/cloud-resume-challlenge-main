HTML and CSS using template from Using template from [startbootstrap-resume](https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-resume)

## HTML Adjustments

- UTF8, main language English.
- Mobile styling include viewport meta tag width=device-width.
- Stylesheet afte we satisfy with HTML markup.
- Simplify HTML markup CSS selector to be as minimal as possible.
- For the HTML page, use tabs 2 spaces.

## Serve Static Website Locally

- Purpose is so we can start using stylesheet externally from out HTML page in a Cloud Developer Environment (CDE). THis is not necessary with local development.

Assuming we have node install we'll use the simple web-server http-server
```sh
npm i http-server -g
```

https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server

### Server Website

http-server will serve public folder by default where the command is run.

```sh
cd frontend
http-server
```

## Image Size Consideration

- Ensure size is small, less than 100kb

## Update HTML to React Vite
- Use AI assistance to transform HTML and CSS file created previously to work in React Vite style.

## API ViewCounter

A Python FastAPI backend that tracks resume page views.

## Frontend Framework Consideration
1. Modern build Tooling: Vite with Rust based bundler.
2. Serverless ready architecture: Client side SPA enabling zero-infrastructure deployment to cloud services.
3. Maintainable config: Centralized constants and environment variables.
